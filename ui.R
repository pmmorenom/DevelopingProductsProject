                             happen in the final laps of a race between two cars. Suppose that Mercedes and
                             Ferrari are in the final laps of a race and one car is faster than the other. The question
                             is about if the second card will have enough time to overtake the first car. This
                             is a question that F1 teams analyze in the races. Here, there is a very simple simulation
                             in which we supponse that the lap times for each car are constant so there  
                             the  gap between cars is reduced linearly. Moreover, we suppose that the car overtakes
                             the other when the gap is 0. This is not in practice, but it serves
                             to have a simple model. In order to use this app, you need to specify the following

                             you specified as a leader is in front. When the value is negative, it means that the second car
                             overtook the first. The lap where the overtake is produced is the lap where the gap is 0. The
